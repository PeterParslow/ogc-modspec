== Requirements Class: The Specification (Core)

[[cls-6-1]]
=== The standards model

The ModSpec defines requirements for specifying the structure as organized sets of
criteria, those that are to be tested ("requirements") and those that are not tested
("recommendations" and "permissions"). All standards, formally or informally, create an
abstraction of the things to which they apply in order to provide a context for stating
requirements. 

This document assumes that the standards addressed are in a commonly used
logical form. This form can be specified by the following descriptions:

. A standard contains Clauses (corresponding to numbered sections as they might
appear in a table of contents) which describe its standardization target and its
requirements.
. A standard contains Annexes or is associated to other documents (both a
logical type of Clause), one of which is the Conformance Test Suite (which may be an
abstract description of the test suites to be implemented separately). In OGC Documents, this is Annex A – Abstract Test Suite.
. All requirements, recommendations, permissions, and models are introduced and defined first in
the numbered Clauses.
. All requirements are identifiable as requirements. In standards documents, this means use
of "normative" language. In the OGC, ISO and other SDOs, this means the proper use of SHALL, SHOULD, CAN and MAY or
similar wording in the passive voice. Other SDOs such as the IETF use "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
 NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" as per RFC 2119.
. All tests for conformance to those requirements are defined in the Conformance Test
Suite. (also known as the Abstract Test Suite (ATS) in OGC documents).
. Tests may be grouped for convenience into conformance test classes.
. The tests, if conducted, will determine to some degree of certainty whether an
implementation meets the requirements which the tests reference.
. The tests are organized into some number of conformance "classes" where each conformance class has a one to one 
relationship with a requirements class. If a standard does not do this, it is has by default only one "conformance class".
. Certificates of conformance (see <<term-all-components-schema-document>>) are
awarded by a testing entity based on these conformance classes.
. There is a clear distinction between normative and informative parts of the text.
. Examples and notes are informative, and do not use "normative"
language.{blank}footnote:[In this document, in informative sections, the word "will"
implies that something is an implication of a requirement. The "will" statements are
not requirements, but explain the consequence of requirements.]

A UML representation of important properties of this model is given in <<annex-C-2>>.

This document defines a "requirement" of a standard as an atomic testable
criterion. See the formal definition of requirement in <<term-requirement>>

[[req-1]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
====
#All the parts of a requirement, a requirement module or requirements class _SHALL_ be
testable. Failure to meet any part of any requirement shall be a failure to pass the
associated conformance test class.#
====

[NOTE]
====
This means that any failure to pass the test specified for a part of requirement is a
failure to pass the requirement.
====

[[req-2]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
====
#Each component of the standard, including requirements, requirements modules,
requirements classes, conformance tests, conformance modules and conformance
classes _SHALL_ be assigned a URI as specified by the OGC Naming Authority or its
equivalent.#
====

*#These URI identities should be used in any external documentation that reference
these component elements in a normative manner, including but not limited to other
standards, implementations of the conformance test suite, or certificates of
conformance for implementations conformant to the standard in question.#* The precise
enforcement of this requirement and its associated recommendation is the purview of
the OGC Naming Authority or its equivalence.

While a requirement may be referenced in more than one place in a standard, the normative definition of a requirement shall be its "*#home#*" (see <<cls-5-3>>) and
will be the only place where full normative language is used. 

In the conformance test suite there will be a test defined to verify the validity of
the claim that an implementation of the standard (standardization target) satisfies
each requirement. Since the normative language of the body of the standard and the
conformance test classes both define what conformance to the standard means, they
will be equivalent in a well-written standard. This document requires
standards to be well-written, at least in stating requirements and conformance
tests.

Conformance tests are aggregated into conformance classes that specify how certain
"certificates of conformance" are achieved. The natural inclination is to aggregate
the requirements. The issue that blocks this approach is that some requirements are
optional while others are mandatory. To achieve a cleaner separation of requirements,
this document separates them into sets (called "requirements classes"), each of which
has no optional components. Since the normative statement of each requirement is only declared once and is uniquely identified as such , each requirement will be in a clause associated to its requirements class.

So, this document defines a "requirements class" as a set of requirements that must
all be passed to achieve a particular conformance class (see
<<term-conformance-test-class>>). This document also specifies a structure
called a conformance test module. Therefore this document also includes requirements modules to
parallel the conformance test modules. A standard written to this document may
use this "module" structure in any manner consistent with the rest of this document. A requirements module is a collection of requirements classes, recommendations, permissions with the same standardization target type.

A standard may have mandatory and optional requirements classes.  This allows the options
in the testing procedure to be grouped into non-varying mandatory and optional conformance classes
To conform to the ModSpec, requirements classes may be optional. Each
requirement within a requirements class is mandatory when that requirements class is
implemented. A requirements class may contain only a single requirement.

However, care must be taken, since the requirements classes may not always in a one-to-one
correspondence to conformance classes in other standards which may be the source of
requirements for a standard conformant with the ModSpec. If other standards are
used, their options shall be specified to be useable within a standard conformant to
this document, see <<cls-6-5-1>>.

NOTE: Carl Comment: I think an example of what John is stating would be OGC API Records normatively referencing a mandatory requirements class specified in OGC API Common.

Conformance classes may contain dependencies on one another. These are represented by
tests in one conformance class that state that another conformance class must be
passed to qualify to pass this conformance class. In terms of requirements, that says
that the dependent conformance class contains tests (by reference) for all
requirements of the "included" conformance class.

In the ModSpec's view of requirements classes, one requirements
class is dependent on another if the other is included through such a reference. In
this manner, requirements classes can be treated as sets of requirements (each in a
single requirements class but included in others by reference to its "home"
requirements class).

A "core" requirements class is one which is a dependency of all others (see
<<term-core-requirements-class>>). 

In this document, each conformance requirement is separated in its own labeled
paragraph, such as <<req-1>> above.

The distribution of the information in a standard is not restricted. The only
requirement will be that requirements be grouped in a manner
consistent with the conformance test classes, see <<req-6>> and <<req-7>>. *#The
informational and structural universals of the standard may be included in the
core text and its associated models without violations of this standard.#* This is
true if the requirements of the extension are not implicit in what is
included in the core.

In this manner, the core requirements class and its associated contents can be
thought of not only as the requirements of the core conformance class, but as a form
of reference model for establishing core vocabularies and schemas for the entire
standard.

The core may contain the definition and schema of commonly used terms and data
structures for use in other structures throughout the standard.

This may include the list of the names of all operations and operation parameters
to be used in any request-response pairs defined in any conformance class of the
standard. If a service receives a request that is not supported in its
conformance claim, then the service may return an error message text stating that the
requested operation is part of a non-supported extension.

[[req-3]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
====
#Requirements on the use and interpretation of vocabulary _SHALL_ be in the
requirements class where that use or interpretation is used.#
====

*#Importation of external vocabularies and schemas may be in the core.#*

[example]
====
In the specification of a metadata service, the Dublin Core concept of a "Title" and
the XML schema structure used for its specification can be in the core of the service
specification. How a particular request-response pair uses the data structure to mean
the title of a particular document or dataset will be specified in the requirements
class in which the request-response pair is defined and set against requirements.
====

[[cls-6-2]]
=== Using the specification model

The primary difficulty in speaking about standards (or candidate
standards){blank}footnote:[This is purposely written as "as yet not adopted"
standards, since it is during the authoring process that this standard must be
considered, not _ex post facto_.] as a group is their diverse
nature. Some standrds use UML to define behavior, others use XML or JSON to define data
structures, and others use no specific modeling language at all. However, they all
must model the standardization target to which they apply since they need to use
unambiguous language to specify requirements. Thus, the only thing they have in
common is that they define testable requirements and recommendations against some
model of an implementation of the standard (the standardization target). For
completeness, they should also specify the conformance tests for these requirements
that are to be run for validation of the implementations against those
requirements.{blank}footnote:[The requirment for a "test suite" is a requirement for
ISO and for the OGC, but is often ignored in less formal standardization efforts. In such
cases, if there exists a "validation authority" for conformance, they must interpret
the requirements to be tested, _ex parte_, possibly separated from the authors of the
standard, leading to issues of separate interpretations of the same standard.]

The assumption is that each standard has a single
(root) standardization target type from which all extensions inherit. If this is not
true, then the standard can be logically factored into parts each corresponding
to a "root" standardization target type, and that the standard addresses each
such part separately (see the definition of requirements class in
<<term-requirements-class>>). In this sense, the next requirement divides a
standard into parts more than restricting their content.

[[req-4]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
====
#Each requirement in a conformant specification _SHALL_ have a single standardization
target type.#
====

In practice, the standardization target of the core requirements class is the root
of an inheritance tree where extensions all have the core's target as an ancestor,
and thus can be considered as belonging to the same "class" or type as the core's
target.

[[req-5]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
====
#All conformance tests in a single conformance test class in a conformant
standard shall have the same standardization target.#
====

This means that all requirements are considered as targeting the same entity being
tested for a particular certificate of conformance. The test may specify other types
as intermediaries or indirect dependencies (see
<<term-indirect-dependency-(of-a-requirements-class)>>).

*#If needed, a requirement may be repeated word for word in another requirement up
to but not including the identification of the standardization target type.#* This
second statement will be in a separate requirements class, since it will have a
separate standardization target and thus belong to the requirements to be tested by
a separate conformance class. For example, in a service interface, a standard
may be written that requires both the client and server to use a particular language
for data transmission. Since the client and server are different standardization
targets types (except in some special circumstances), they will have different
conformance test classes.

One solution is to state the requirement twice, once for each target. The most
common alternative is to introduce a new "superclass". *#The specification may
introduce an abstract superclass of all affected standardization target types and
use this for the requirements common to all of the affected target types.#* This is
diagrammed in <<fig-6-1>>.

[[fig-6-1]]
.Abstract superclass example
image::img01.png[]

[[example-6-1]]
[example]
.Abstract Superclass
====
In <<fig-6-1>>, `"Web Application"` has been created as an abstract superclass of
`"Web Server"` and `"Web Client."` In this manner, any common requirement for `"Web
Server"` and `"Web Client"` can be laid against the abstract superclass `"Web
Application"` and does not have to be repeated. Because the subclassing created a
direct dependency from the packages containing `"Web Server"` or `"Web Client"` and
that containing `"Web Application"` a corresponding direct dependency will exist at
the conformance class level so that any requirement or compliance test defined for
`"Web Application"` will also apply to directly to both `"Web Server"` and `"Web
Client."` The conformance class of `"Web Application"` is tested whenever either
`"Web Service"` or `"Web Client"` is tested see <<req-12>>.

Using this technique may pose some problems at the concrete level because the
semantics of the requirement may shift subtly between the `"Web Server"` and the
`"Web Client."` If this happens, the original requirement statement at `"Web
Application"` might be ambiguously stated (it has multiple semantically distinct
interpretations depending on the subclass of `"Web Application"` to which it is
applied). It would be appropriate in this case to move the requirement down from the
abstract superclass, replicating it into each of the subclasses, where it can be
stated more precisely.

The conformance class of `"Web Application"` is tested whenever either `"Web
Service"` or `"Web Client"` is tested, see <<req-12>>.

[[cls-6-3]]
=== The "standards" document structure

Each standard is a set of requirements and their associated conformance tests.

[[req-6]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
====
#Requirements _SHALL_ be grouped together in clauses (numbered sections) of the
document in a strictly hierarchical manner, consistent with requirements modules and
requirements classes.#
====

[[req-7]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
====
#The requirements structure and the conformance test suite structure shall be consistent.#
====

This structure is described in the following clause. Thus, if two requirements are
in the same clause of the body of the document, they should be tested in the same
class in the conformance suite. *#Each requirement may be separately identifiable
either by a label as is done in this document, by its subclause number, or by its
subclause number and full text.#*

[[cls-6-4]]
=== Conformance Test Suite

The following requirements will be applied directly to the test suite, and in particular
to the conformance classes. By definition, a "test suite" is a collection of
identifiable conformance classes and/or conformance mosdules. A conformance class is a well-defined set of
conformance tests. Each conformance test is a concrete or abstract (depending on the
type of suite) description of a test to be performed on each candidate conformant
implementation. Conformance tests are used to determine if an implementation meets a well-defined set of requirements as
stated in the normative clauses of the standards document.

NOTE: The Test Suite is normative in the sense that it describes the tests to be
performed to pass conformance, but it specifies no requirements in any other sense.
The requirements are specified in the body of the standard. The test suite
only describes in detail how those requirements should be tested.

In each of the profiles defined in the Clauses to follow, some set of entities,
types, elements or objects are defined and segregated into implementation
requirements classes.

NOTE: CNR Comment: Not sure what the above “profiles” references or means in this context.

[[req-8]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
====
#The requirements classes _SHALL_ be in a one-to-one correspondence to the conformance
test classes, and thus to the various certificate of conformance types possible for
a candidate implementation.#
====

Strict parallelism of implementation and governance is the essence of this document.

=== Requirements for Modularity

[[cls-6-5-1]]
==== Each Conformance class tests a complete requirements class

[[req-9]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
====
#A Conformance class _SHALL_ not contain any optional conformance tests.#
====

This requirement stops
conformance classes from containing optional requirements and tests, and, at least
as far as the standard is concerned, makes all certificates of conformance mean
that the same tests have been conducted. Standards may use
recommendations for such options, but the conformance test classes do not test
recommendations.

NOTE: CNR Comment on the following two paragraphs: Do any OGC or ISO standards do the following? If not, I recommend removing.

*#A Conformance class may be parameterized.#* This means that the class's tests
depend on some parameter that must be defined before the tests can be executed. For
example, if a XYZ conformance class needs to specify a data format such as GML or
KML to be tested, then XYZ(GML) is XYZ using GML, and XYZ(KML) is XYZ using KML.
*#Because the parameters choose which requirements will be tested, two conformance
classes with distinct parameters should be considered as distinct conformance
classes.#*

The most common parameters are the identities of indirect dependencies. For example,
if a service uses or produces feature data, the format of that data may be a
parameter, such as GML, KML or GeoJSON. When reading a certificate of conformance,
the values of such parameters are very important.

[[req-10]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
====
#A certificate of conformance shall specify all parameter values used to pass the
tests in its conformance test class.#
====

Conformance to a particular conformance class means the same thing everywhere.

[[req-11]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
====
#A Conformance class _SHALL_ explicitly test only requirements from a single
requirements class.#
====

This means that there is a strict correspondence between the requirements classes
and the conformance test classes in the test suite. Recall that a conformance test
class may specify dependencies causing other conformance test classes to be used,
but this is a result of an explicit requirement in the "home" requirements class.

[[req-12]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
====
#A Conformance class _SHALL_ specify any other conformance class upon which it is
dependent and that other conformance class shall be used to test the specified
dependency.#
====

Such referenced conformance classes may be in the same standard or may be a
conformance class of another standard.

[[example-6-2]]
[example]
.Indirect dependency on schema
====
If a service specifies that a particular output is required to be conformant to a
conformance test class in a specific standard (say a normatively referenced XML
schema), then the conformance class of that normative reference will be used to test
that output. For example, if a Web Feature Service (WFS) implementation instance specifies that its feature collection output is compliant to a particular profile of GML (Geography Markup Language), then that profile of GML will be used to
validate that output. This means that the service is indirectly tested using the GML
standard. In other words, GML is an indirect dependency of the original service.
====

An entire requirements class may be optional but not the individual requirements contained in the requirements class. This means that every implementation that passed a particular conformance class satisfies
the same requirements and passes the same conformance tests. Differences
between implementations will be determined by which conformance test classes are
passed, not by listing of which options within a class were tested. If a
standard's authors wish to make a particular requirement optional, <<req-9>>
this requirement must be included in a separate requirements class (and therefore in a
separate conformance test class) which can be left untested.

Other standards do not follow a strict parallelism between requirement specification
and testing, so for use within a standard compliant with the ModSpecd, special
care must be taken in importing conformance test classes from other standards.

[[req-13]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
====
#If a requirements class is imported from another standard for use within a
standard conformant with the ModSpec, and if any imported requirement is
"optional," then that requirement _SHALL_ be factored out as a separate requirements
class in the profile of that imported standard used in the conformant standard.
Each such used requirements class _SHALL_ be a conformance class of the source
standard or a combination of conformance classes of the source standard or standards.#
====

NOTE: CNR COmment - A bit confusing. Also, need to consider how linking to the requirements class specified in the external document are handled. Critical to the OGC API Standards suite that have many direct and indirect dependencies.

The tracking of the parallelism between requirements and tesst should be easy if the
standards document is non-ambiguous. To insure this, by utilizing the names of the two types of classes the following requirement places adefault mapping between the two.

[[req-14]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
====
#For clarity and ease of external reference, all requirements classes and all
conformance test classes _SHALL_ be explicitly named, with corresponding requirements
classes and conformance test classes having similar names.#
====

[NOTE]
====
Logically, a requirements class (set of requirements) and a conformance class (set
of tests) are not comparable. This can be remedied by noting that both have a
consistent relation to a set of requirements. A requirements class is a set of
requirements. A conformance class tests a set of requirements. Therefore a requirements class corresponds precisely to a conformance class if they both are related (as described) to the same set of requirements.
====

[[cls-6-5-2]]
==== Requirements classes contain all requirements tested by a conformance test

[[req-15]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
====
#Each requirement in the standard _SHALL_ be contained in one and only one
requirements class. Inclusion of any requirement in a requirements class by a
conformance class shall imply inclusion of all requirements in its class (as a
dependency).#
====

Unless a requirement is referenced in a conformance test and thus in a conformance
class, it cannot be considered a requirement since no test has been defined for it.
*#If possible, the structure of the normative clauses of the standard should
parallel the structure of the conformance classes in the conformance clause.#*

[NOTE]
====
This in conjunction with <<req-9>> means that all requirements in a conformant
standrd will be tested in some conformance class. In the best example, a
requirement should be contained explicitly in one and only one requirements class
and tested in one and only one conformance class. This is not really a requirement
here, since a single requirement can be stated twice in different requirements
classes.
====

[[req-16]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
====
#If any two requirements or two requirements modules are co-dependent (each
dependent on the other) then they _SHALL_ be in the same requirements class. If any
two requirements classes are co-dependent, they shall be merged into a single class.#
====

Normally, circular dependencies between implementation components are signs of a
poor design, but they often cannot be avoided because of other considerations (code
ownership for example). *#Circular dependencies of all types should be avoided
whenever possible.#*

[[req-17]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
====
#There _SHALL_ be a natural structure on the requirements classes so that each may be
implemented on top of any implementations of its dependencies and independent of its
extensions.#
====

[NOTE]
====
The only certain approach to testing this requirement maybe to create a reference
implementation.

This requirement is more important and may be more difficult than it seems. It
states simply that conformance classes and their associated requirements classes can
be put in a one-to-one correspondence to a fully modular implementation of the
complete standard (at least all of the specification against a single
standardization target). Implementors who wish to sacrifice modularity for some
other benefit can still do what they want; the requirement here only states that if
the software requirements classes are properly separated, they can be implemented in
a "plug'n'play" fashion.
====

[[req-18]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
====
#No requirements class _SHALL_ redefine the requirements of its dependencies, unless
that redefinition is for an entity derived from but not contained in those
dependencies.#
====

This means, for example, that a UML classifier cannot be redefined in a new
extension. If a new version of the classifier is needed it must be a valid subtype
of the original.

In terms of generalization, subclassing, extension and restriction (into a new class
or type) are all acceptable, redefinition (of an old class or type) is not.

[NOTE]
====
<<cls-6-3>> makes some pointed suggestion as to how to organize the conformance
classes and normative clauses in parallel to make this requirement easier to verify.

Most standards include examples, which are useful for illustrative or pedagogical
purposes. However, it is not possible to write a testable standard "by example". Examples are therefore non-normative, by definition.
====

[[cls-6-5-3]]
==== Profiles are defined as sets of conformance classes

All the conformance classes created in a standard form a base (an upper bound
of all conformance classes) for defining profiles as defined in ISO/IEC 10000 (see
<<iso-dp2>>). The base for creating a profile can be defined as the union of all
requirements classes.

[[req-19]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
====
#The conformance tests for a profile of a standrd _SHALL_ be defined as the
union of a list of conformance classes that are to be satisfied by that profile's
standardization targets.#
====

NOTE: This means that a standard conformant to this document predefines all of its
possible profiles through the dependencies between the conformance classes. In
essence, a profile of a conformant standard is precisely a transitive closure of a
subset of requirements classes under the dependency relations.

[[cls-6-5-4]]
==== There is a Defined Core

[[req-20]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
====
#Every standard _SHALL_ define and identify a core set of requirements as a
separate conformance class.#
====

[[req-21]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
====
#All general recommendations _SHALL_ be in the core.#
====

[[req-22]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
====
#Every other requirements class in a standrd _SHALL_ have a standardization
target type which is a subtype of that of the core and _SHALL_ have the core as a
direct dependency.#
====

*#This core may be partially or totally abstract. The core should be as simple as
possible. The core requirements class may be a conformance class in another
standard, in which case the current specification should identify any optional tests
in that conformance class that are required by the current standard's core
requirements class.#* See <<req-13>>.

Since the core requirements class is contained (as a direct dependency) in each
other requirements class with a similar standardization target type, the general
recommendations are thus universal to all requirements classes. *#Since the basic
concept of some standards is mechanism not implementation, the core may contain only
recommendations, and include no requirements.#*

NOTE: In most cases, if someone feels the need to define a "simple" version of the
standard, it is probably a good approximation of the best core. For example, the
core of a refactored GML might be the equivalent of the "GML for Simple Features"
profile. The core for any SQL version of feature geometry is probably "Simple
Features."

[[cls-6-5-5]]
==== Extensions are requirements classes

A common mechanism to extend the functionality of a standard is to define
extensions, which may be either local or encompass other standards. *#Standards
should use extensions as required and feasible, but should never hinder them.#*

[[req-23]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
====
#Each Standard conformant to this document _SHALL_ consist of the core and some
number of requirements classes defined as extensions to that core.#
====

[[req-24]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
====
#A standard conformant to this document _SHALL_ require all conformant extensions
to itself to be conformant to the ModSpec.#
====

Since software is evolutionary at its best, it would not be wise to restrict that
evolutionary tendency in a standard, by restricting extensions. A
good standrd will thus list the things a standardization target has to do, but
will never list things that a standardization target might want to do above and
beyond the current design requirements.

[[req-25]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
====
#A standard conformant to this document _SHALL_ never restrict in any manner
future, logically-valid extensions of its standardization targets.#
====

NOTE: CNR Comment: Not sure this paragraph adds anything and is actually a bit confusing.
*#The above requirement should not be interpreted as a restriction on quality
control.#* Any efforts by a specification to enforce a level of quality on its
standardization targets, when well and properly formed; do not interfere with the
proper extension of those targets. So, the specification may require its
standardization targets to behave in a certain manner when presented with a logical
inconsistency, but that inconsistency must be fundamental to the internal logic of
the model, and not a possible extension. Thus, a specification may require a
standardization target to accept GML as a feature specification language, but cannot
require a standardization target to not accept an alternative, such as KML, or
GeoJSON, as long at that alternative can carry viable information consistent with
the fundamental intent of the specification.

[[cls-6-5-6]]
==== Optional requirements are organized as requirements classes

[[req-26]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
====
#The only optional requirements acceptable in a standard conformant to the
ModSpec _SHALL_ be expressible as a list of conformance classes to be passed.#
====

NOTE: CNR Comment: Not sure this paragraph is needed.
Standards and implementations are restricted by this, but not instances of
schemas. For example, a XML schema standard can specify an optional element, which
data instances may use or not., However schema-aware processors claiming conformance
to the standard should be able to handle all elements defined in the schema, whether
they are required by the schema or not.

*#Requirements of the form "if the implementation does this, it must do it this way"
are considered options and _SHOULD_ be in a separate requirements class.#*

[[cls-6-5-7]]
==== Requirements classes intersect overlap only by reference

[[req-27]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
====
#The common portion of any two requirements classes _SHALL_ consist only of references
to other requirements classes.#
====

This implies that each requirement is in exactly one requirements class and
all references to that requirement from another requirements class must include its
complete "home" requirements class. This means that requirements for dependencies
will often result in conformance tests which require the execution of the
dependency conformance class. See for example <<annex-A-2-1>>.

NOTE: All general recommendations are in the core requirements class. The core
conformance test class contains tests that all other conformance classes must pass.
